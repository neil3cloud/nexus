# Nexus Bootstrap Implementation Report

## Scope

This report covers the initial Nexus VS Code extension bootstrap slice and corrective follow-up tasks through Task-005.

Implemented scope:

- Compilable VS Code extension scaffold.
- VS Code host activation and `nexus.initializeWorkspace` command registration.
- Kernel creation, service coordination, initialization, health reporting, and shutdown.
- Placeholder Kernel services for Mission, Evidence, Shared Reality, Execution, Review, and Knowledge.
- Capability-based Kernel folder structure with cross-cutting Kernel infrastructure under `src/kernel/common/`.
- RFC-0005-aligned DomainEvent contract and hardened in-memory EventBus infrastructure.
- Terminal EventBus disposal behavior that rejects publish, subscribe, and replay after disposal.
- EventBus publication validation for the RFC-0005 Mission attribution invariant.
- Event Bus reference documentation reconciled to the implemented `replay(missionId)` contract and terminal-disposal behavior.
- Terminal Kernel disposal semantics aligned with the Kernel-owned terminal EventBus lifecycle.
- Contract deduplication and removal of speculative placeholder interfaces/directories.
- Corrected Kernel Event Catalog envelope documentation.
- Strict TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest, esbuild, and npm validation configuration.
- VS Code host command semantics and lifecycle cleanup for honest initialization reporting and single-owner disposal.

Not implemented:

- Mission Aggregate.
- Mission Repository.
- Mission execution.
- AI providers or adapters.
- Shared Reality computation.
- Review engine.
- Knowledge persistence.
- Durable event persistence.
- Telemetry.
- Storage.
- Networking.
- Git integration.
- MCP integration.
- Settings UI, webviews, or authentication.

- `knowledge/reference/kernel-dependency-graph.md`.

## Assumptions

- In-memory EventBus replay is acceptable for the bootstrap slice because durable event persistence is outside the requested milestone.
- Placeholder services may expose only lifecycle and health behavior until their owning vertical slices implement domain behavior.
- Public capability contracts may remain even when not yet consumed internally.
- The VS Code host owns the Pino-backed adapter for `KernelLogger`; the Kernel remains independent of Pino.

## Limitations

- Event replay is process-local and is lost when the extension process exits.
- The Kernel does not yet persist Domain Events, Evidence, Knowledge, Missions, or service state.
- Placeholder services do not implement domain behavior.
- The extension registers one command and does not expose additional UI.
- The Event Catalog still contains broader event names and service naming that may require future RFC/reference reconciliation.
- The Projection Service versus Shared Reality naming conflict identified during Task-002 remains unresolved and requires human ratification before broad reference-document renaming.

## Architectural Deviations

No architectural deviations.

## Process Deviations

Tasks 005, 007, 008, and 009 were implemented beyond the authorized scope of sprint `NEXUS-SPRINT-2026-07-11-001`, which listed only Tasks 001, 002, 003, 004, and 006 for implementation. This process deviation was accepted by review `NEXUS-REV-2026-07-12-001`.

Future sprints will implement only the tasks explicitly listed in the authorized sprint scope.
